<h1>Current state of the xUnit.net v3 alpha</h1>
<h2>As of: 2023 July 27 (<code>0.1.1-pre.267</code>)</h2>

<p>
  The purpose of this document is to give a general state of the alpha
  package releases of xUnit.net v3. I will work to update this document
  after each purposeful release, both by updating the general structure
  of the content as well as to provide a quick diff from the previous
  release. In particular, save yourself a lot of grief by checking out
  the "Known issues" section. :)

<h2 id="v2-changes">Big changes from v2</h2>

<p>This list highlights the major architectural changes in v3.</p>

<h3>New minimum runtime requirements</h3>

<p>
  For unit test authors, we have bumped up the minimum runtime requirements to match
  with our move to <code>netstandard2.0</code>. Today, our supported runtimes include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>.NET Framework 4.7.2 (or later)</li>
  <li>.NET 6 (or later)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Also new for v3: Mono is officially supported on Linux and macOS for .NET Framework
  test projects. While it did often work with v1 and v2, we do officially test and
  verify with it now.
</p>
<p>
  The full list of planned runtimes for v3 can be found in our
  <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2330">roadmap</a>.
</p>

<h3>Unit test projects are applications now</h3>

<p>
  With xUnit.net v1 and v2, unit test projects were class library projects;
  that is, when compiled, they always generated <code>.dll</code> files,
  which relied upon an external runner to run.
</p>
<p>
  This is a design that dates back to the beginnings of .NET Framework, long
  before .NET Core came into being. Even then it had some unfortunate downsides.
  Let's take a look at a couple.
</p>
<p>
  One example is library dependency management: if the runner loads your test
  assembly into the same process as itself, and both pieces of code wish to use
  a library, there was a "first one wins" conflict, which meant your unit test
  always lost. In .NET Framework, the workaround was App Domains, which is not
  available with .NET Core (and sometimes test code didn't run properly with
  app domains). Additionally, the assembly dependency resolution system in .NET
  Core is exceptionally complex and not designed to consumed directly (especially
  as it pertained to un-managed dependencies, like Win32 DLLs), so it was a frequent
  problem running .NET Core tests in-line with a runner.
</p>
<p>
  Our second example is that there are some things that can only be chosen on
  a process basis, not an App Domain basis. One category of those things would be
  where .NET APIs are just thin wrappers around Win32 functionality, where there's
  no App Domain awareness; the most common one that bit people with testing is
  <code>Directory.SetCurrentDirectory</code>. If a runner had loaded multiple test
  assemblies to run in parallel, and they each call that API, they are mutating a
  piece of shared state, which can cause unpredictable failures. Similarly, with
  .NET Framework, the "chosen" version of the .NET Framework (as well as 32- vs.
  64-bit-ness) is a decision made by the process, which in the case of stand alone
  runners means the <i>runner</i> chooses that rather than the unit test. This became
  such a significant issue that we shipped at least a dozen versions of the console
  runner at a time: the cross-product of 32- vs. 64-bit and .NET 4.5.2 vs. 4.6 vs.
  4.6.1, etc.
</p>
<p>
  The solution to all these problems is that unit tests should be run in their own
  process. It lets us leverage the existing assembly resolution logic without needing
  anything special, and offers a better level of isolation from one test project
  to another when running in parallel.
</p>

<h3>netstandard2.0 is the new norm</h3>

<p>
  In v2, we separated two libraries: <code>xunit.core.dll</code> and
  <code>xunit.execution.*.dll</code>. The purpose of this separation was two-fold:
  to isolate the code used to write tests and the code used to run those tests;
  to hide the fact that while <code>core</code> targeted <code>netstandard1.1</code>,
  <code>execution</code> was forced to ship framework-specific DLLs.
</p>
<p>
  With v3, these two libraries have been collapsed into <code>xunit.v3.core.dll</code>
  and the target is now <code>netstandard2.0</code>. This will primarily benefit
  extensibility authors who previously had to choose whether to extend <code>core</code>
  and/or <code>execution</code>, and more specifically, had to ship multi-targeted
  libraries to match whichever runtimes they wanted to support.
</p>
<p>
  Note that currently the <code>xunit.v3.core</code> (and <code>xunit.v3</code>) NuGet
  package shows target frameworks of <code>net472</code> and <code>net6.0</code>
  because of the in-process runner requirement. Developers who extend xUnit.net will
  instead use the <code>xunit.v3.extensibility.core</code> NuGet package, which is
  single-targeted against <code>netstandard2.0</code>. Extensibility authors will no
  longer need to ship multi-targeted NuGet packages.
</p>

<h3>Primary build system is now Linux</h3>

<p>
  This will typically only affect developers who wish to contribute PRs to xUnit.net.
  Our CI process runs everything against Windows, Linux, and macOS; the final binaries
  are built on Linux. We do still provide Visual Studio solution files for those who
  wish to run Visual Studio, but we also provide Visual Studio Code build and debug
  gestures. We ship both PowerShell and bash supported <code>build</code> commands.
</p>


<h2 id="feed">Add nuget.config with CI package feed URL</h2>

<p>
  The CI builds are hosted on <a href="https://feedz.io/org/xunit/repository/xunit/search">feedz.io</a>.
  In order to download packages from this feed, you need to configure it with a
  <code>nuget.config</code> file. Regardless of whether you're planning to upgrade
  an existing project from v2 to v3, or start a new v3 project, you must take this
  step first or else package restore of the v3 packages will fail.
</p>
<p>
  In your solution folder, create a file named <code>nuget.config</code> and add the following
  contents:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <clear />
    <add key="nuget" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
    <add key="xunit-ci" value="https://f.feedz.io/xunit/xunit/nuget/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
{% endhighlight %}

<p><em>
  <strong>Note:</strong> You may need to restart your IDE for it to pick up these changes.
</em></p>
<p>
  If you already have a <code>nuget.config</code> file, you can simply merge the
  <code>&lt;add key="xunit-ci" ...&gt;</code> line into it.
</p>


<h2 id="migrating-from-v2">Migrating a test project from v2 to v3</h2>

<p>
  The following is a quick list of changes that are needed when moving a test project
  from v2 to v3. Your project may require additional changes. Note that it's generally
  expected that unit test projects should "just work" when migrating from v2 to v3;
  porting extensibility libraries from v2 to v3 is beyond the scope of this document
  at this time (in addition to the APIs being still very much under development).
</p>

<h3>Update NuGet package references</h3>

<p>Change the following package references:</p>
<table class="table latest">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>v2 package</th><th>v3 package</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td><code>xunit</code></td><td><code>xunit.v3</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>xunit.abstractions</code></td><td>Remove, no longer required</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>xunit.analyzers</code></td><td>Unchanged (though there are no v3-specific analyzers yet)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>xunit.assert</code></td><td><code>xunit.v3.assert</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>xunit.assert.source</code></td><td><code>xunit.v3.assert.source</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>xunit.console</code></td><td>Not yet available</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>xunit.core</code></td><td><code>xunit.v3.core</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>xunit.extensibility.core</code><br /><code>xunit.extensibility.execution</code></td><td><code>xunit.v3.extensibility.core</code> (*)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>xunit.runner.console</code></td><td>Not yet available</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>xunit.runner.msbuild</code></td><td>Not yet available</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>xunit.runner.reporters</code><br /><code>xunit.runner.utility</code></td><td><code>xunit.v3.runner.utility</code> (*)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code></td><td>Unchanged (though v3 is not yet supported)</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><em>
  <strong>Note:</strong> In some cases multiple libraries/packages were merged together into a
  single new library/package, as denoted in the table above with (*).
</em></p>

<h3>Convert to executable project</h3>

<p>
  Update your project file (i.e., <code>.csproj</code>) and change <code>OutputType</code> from
  <code>Library</code> to <code>Exe</code>. You may need to add <code>OutputType</code> if it's
  not present, since <code>Library</code> is the default value:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<PropertyGroup>
  <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
</PropertyGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Update target framework</h3>

<p>
  There are new <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2330">minimum target framework
  versions</a>; make sure to update your target framework(s) if you're currently targeting something
  that's too old.
</p>


<h2 id="creating-test-project">Creating a new v3 test project</h2>

<p>
  Since there is no project template yet for xUnit.net v3, you should
  create a project using <code>dotnet new console</code> from the .NET
  SDK command line tool. We currently support C#, F#, and VB.NET,
  targeting .NET Framework 4.7.2+ and/or .NET 6+.
</p>
<p>After creation, edit your project file to make it look like this:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="xunit.v3" Version="0.1.1-pre.267" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
{% endhighlight %}


<h2 id="running-test-project">Running a v3 test project</h2>

<p>
  In current form, the only way to run unit test projects is directly,
  since they are executables. All test projects are linked with an "in-process
  runner" for their appropriate target framework, which
</p>
<p>
  .NET Framework projects directly result in a <code>.exe</code> file,
  which can be directly run on Windows or run via Mono on Linux and
  macOS. The executable has many of the same command line options that
  you're accustomed to having access to with the stand-alone console
  runner; simply run <code>MyTests.exe -?</code> to get a help page full
  of available options.
</p>
<p>
  .NET projects can be run with <code>dotnet run</code> (advanced
  users can also use <code>dotnet exec</code>). To run a project, use
  a command like <code>dotnet run --project src/MyTests/MyTests.csproj</code>.
  This also supports command line options; to specify them with dotnet run,
  you need to include a double-dash to separate dotnet run's options from
  your program options. To see the help page, for example, run
  <code>dotnet run --project src/MyTests/MyTests.csproj -- -?</code>.
</p>
<p>
  If your test project is multi-targeted, you must specify <code>--framework</code>
  when using <code>dotnet run</code>. Note that <code>dotnet run</code> is also able
  to run .NET Framework projects (assuming you have Mono installed), so you can use
  <code>dotnet run</code> for both types of project if you wish.
</p>


<h2 id="overriding-entry-point">Overriding the entry point</h2>

<p>
  Since unit test projects are programs, that means they need a <code>Main</code>
  method. However, you didn't write one, so where did it come from?
</p>
<p>
  We inject one. Here are the three versions:
</p>

<div class="radio-selector">
  <input type="radio" name="language" data-selector=".language-csharp" checked="checked" /> C#
  <input type="radio" name="language" data-selector=".language-fsharp" /> F#
  <input type="radio" name="language" data-selector=".language-vb" /> Visual Basic
</div>

<div class="language-csharp">
{% highlight csharp %}
using Xunit.Runner.InProc.SystemConsole;

public class AutoGeneratedEntryPoint
{
    public static int Main(string[] args)
    {
        return ConsoleRunner.Run(args).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="language-fsharp hidden">
{% highlight fsharp %}
module AutoGeneratedEntryPoint

open Xunit.Runner.InProc.SystemConsole

[<EntryPoint>]
let main args =
    ConsoleRunner.Run(args).GetAwaiter().GetResult()
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="language-vb hidden">
{% highlight vb %}
Imports Xunit.Runner.InProc.SystemConsole

Public Class AutoGeneratedEntryPoint
    Public Shared Function Main(args As String()) As Integer
        Return ConsoleRunner.Run(args, Nothing, Nothing, Nothing).GetAwaiter().GetResult()
    End Function
End Class
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<p>
  If you want to provide your own entry point (for example, because you want
  to run ASP.NET Core initialization code before running your tests), you can
  set the following property in your project file:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<PropertyGroup>
  <XunitAutoGeneratedEntryPoint>false</XunitAutoGeneratedEntryPoint>
</PropertyGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Once you've done this, you're responsible for defining the <code>Main</code> method
  for your application, and then calling <code>ConsoleRunner.Run</code> to get
  things started.
</p>


<h2 id="known-issues">Known issues</h2>

<p>
  As always, the best place to keep track of the ongoing work is the
  <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2133">roadmap</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>No v3 support in <code>xunit.v3.runner.utility</code>.</strong><br />
    The <code>xunit.v3.runner.utility</code> claims to support running v3 projects
    in the NuGet package description, but this support is not yet enabled. This library
    should still be able to run v1 and v2 projects, though.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No stand-alone runners.</strong><br />
    This release does not yet include any of the stand-alone runners (namely,
    the console and MSBuild runner). Since these runners cannot run v3 tests
    yet, I've decided not to ship them yet.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No 3rd party runners.</strong><br />
    Since runner utility does not yet support v3 tests, that means it isn't possible
    to ship a 3rd party runner that supports running v3 projects yet. Most notably,
    that means <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code> is not yet available with v3
    support, so there is no support for running tests inside of Visual Studio's Test
    Explorer, nor with the <code>dotnet test</code> command line.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Old-style .NET Framework C#/VB project issues.</strong><br />
    In general, new (SDK-style) projects are preferred and supported. Old-style project
    files for .NET Framework C# and VB should work as well; if you start by creating a
    .NET Framework Console application project, make sure to delete the generated entry
    point (<code>Program.cs</code> for C# and <code>Module1.vb</code> for VB) and make
    sure to remove any <code>&lt;StartupObject&gt;</code> properties that might exist
    in your project file, as the entry point is automatically provided by the NuGet
    package.
  </li>
</ul>
